# Calendar
Calendar created on React + TypeScript without using moment.js


At the moment there is a bug that I don't understand how to fix. In the calendar component, line 66.
Two errors:
1. The 'map' property does not exist for type 'void',
2. The parameter 'day' is implicitly of type 'any'.

I can't figure out how to solve
